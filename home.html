			It is the gateway to the Annapurna region where many a trekker finds his Shangri-La.

		  Pokhara's spellbinding beauty has been the subject of many travel writers.
	      Its pristine air, the spectacular backdrop of the snowy peaks of the Annapurna Range and the serene Phewa, Begnas and Rupa Lakes, makes this destination "the Jewel of the Himalaya".

          It is home to exceptionally warm and engaging people and is the starting point for treks into the Annapurna
          Himalaya, which dominates the skyline.

          The area along Fewa Tal, the largest lake in the valley, was first a camping ground for trekkers and has gradually developed into the tourist hub of this rapidly growing city.

  	<li>Embark on scenic trekking adventures in the Annapurna region.</li><br>
